# JPEG

Upload an image to get detailed insights about an image and get suggestions on the settings to be used. Everything from shutterspeed, aperture, iso, exposure, to the time it was taken. It uses ClarifAI to understand the image and uses my algorithm to suggest the best camera settings according to the subject and other parameters. More features to come! 

# Setup
1) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) Update `'YOUR_KEY_HERE'` on line 7 with a valid token from ClarifAI
3) run `python app.py`
